# Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute to Marketing for Founders, send me a Pull Request.  Please, follow these guidelines:
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. Briefly check the content in the selected category to ensure that your suggestions don’t repeat existing.   
* **Make an individual Pull Request for each suggestion.**
* Try to make your Pull Request as descriptive as possible. Mention, how this resource or tool helped you. We do hope that you personally read, watch, listen or use stuff that you’re recommending.
* Put your content as the last item in the category.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are more than welcome!
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period and remove trailing whitespace.
* Please, check your spelling and grammar.

## Link Format
Please, use the following format for the links in Pull Requests:
* ``[Title of the Article](link)``.
Feel free to change the title to increase clarity/be more appropriate, if needed.
* ``[Name of the tool](link)``. Mention, how the tool helped you and if it has a free trial or features.


## Content Requirements
* Your submitted content or tool should be useful for other founders. Obviously, it must be relevant for marketing, sales, PR or growth hacking tasks.
* Content should be up to date, well-written and well-structured.
* Videos and podcasts should be in English so anyone from all around the globe can understand!
* Please, don’t submit shameless promotion stuff.
* Software focus of the content is a plus, but not required.
* Tools can be paid, but should have a pricing plan for individuals. Please, don’t submit tools that are oriented toward marketing agencies and cost an enormous amount of money.

## Review Workflow  
I will do my best to review your submission as soon as I can. However, I'd love to take a deep look on it and it might take time.

Your contribution might be rejected if the content or tool didn't pass curation. This can be for multiple reasons: poorly written, too much self-promotion, not relevant in general, etc.
